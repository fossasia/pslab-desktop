	<img src="images/njfet.svg" width="100%"><br>
    Set the gate voltage for various values between 0, and -2 , and observe the effect on saturation current<br>
    <br>
    PV1 is varied in steps, and for each step the current is calculated from the difference between voltages at PV1 and CH1, and the known value of the resistor(560 ohms)<br>
    Acquired plots can be selectively displayed or deleted.<br>
