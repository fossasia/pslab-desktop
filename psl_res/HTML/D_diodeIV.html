	<img src="images/diodeIV.svg" width="100%"><br>
    Connect the Diode from CH3 to Ground.<br>
    Connect a 1k resistor from PV1 to CH3<br>
    <br>
    PV1 is varied in steps, and for each step the current is calculated from the difference between voltages at PV1 and CH3, and the known value of the resistor<br>
    Acquired plots can be selectively displayed or deleted.<br>
