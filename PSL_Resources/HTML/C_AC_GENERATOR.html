	<h3>Make an AC generator using a magnet and a coil</h3>
	<img src="images/acgen.png" style="width:100%;max-width:500px;"><br>
    Make the connections to the solenoid as shown in the figure.<br>
	Now rotate a magnet on the plane containing its magnetic axis, and bring the solenoid close to it such that its axis is also parallel to this plane. Use the picture shown as a reference.<br>
	Observe the plot of the induced EMF, and calculate its time period. This time period should correspond to the RPM of the magnet.
