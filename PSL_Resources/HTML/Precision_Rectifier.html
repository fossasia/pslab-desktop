    The precision rectifier, also known as a super diode, is a configuration obtained with an op-amp in order to have a circuit behave like an ideal diode and rectifier.<br>
    This example shows half-wave rectification using this circuit. Notice how the peaks of both input and output coincide. In the simple diode based rectifier, the 0.6 volt forward threshold voltage causes a similar difference in the peak heights of the input and output waveforms.

	Make the Connections as shown in the figure.<br>
	CH1 monitors the original waveform output from W1.<br>
	CH2 monitors the rectified waveform .<br><br>
	Click on various areas on the plot to activate crosshairs, and note voltage values of the input and output peaks.
