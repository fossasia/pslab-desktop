              A: The goal of PSLab is to create an Open Source hardware device
              (open on all layers) that can be used for experiments by teachers,
              students and citizen scientists. Our tiny pocket science lab
              provides an array of sensors for doing science and engineering
              experiments. It provides functions of numerous measurement devices
              including an oscilloscope, a waveform generator, a frequecy
              counter, a programmable voltage, current source and as a data
              logger.Hence you can perform all kind of experiments using these
              devices.

              A: Pocket Science Lab (PSLab) is a small USB powered hardware
              board that can be used for measurements and experiments. It works
              as an extension for Android phones or PCs. PSLab comes with a
              built-in Oscilloscope, Multimeter, Wave Generator, Logic Analyzer,
              Power Source, and many more instruments. It can also be used as a
              robotics control app. And, we are constantly adding more digital
              instruments. PSLab is many devices in one. Simply connect two
              wires to the relevant pins (description is on the back of the
              PSLab board) and start measuring. You can use our Open Source
              Android or desktop app to view and collect the data. You can also
              plug in hundreds of compatible IÂ²C standard sensors to the PSLab
              pin slots. It works without the need for programming. So, what
              experiments you do is just limited to your imagination!

              100 developers who have contributed to the project across
              different repositories. The project was started after Praveen
              Kumar, a physics teacher from India, introduced the idea of an
              open physics lab device inspired by the ExpEYES project at the
              FOSSASIA Summit in Cambodia 2014. He helped to get the project
              moving forward and worked with early contributors on the software
              components. The Open Hardware board was released in 2017 as part
              of a GSoC project by Jithin B P who used the ExpEYES boards he
              developed earlier as a basis to create the first version of PSLab.
              In the following years hardware components were updated, the size
              and design was adjusted resulting in much lower production costs
              and many features were added in the firmware. An Android app was
              developed from scratch and most of the desktop app re-implemented
              with a new cross-platform Electron frontend. `}
