    Make the connections as shown in the figure<br>
    Select a voltage at PV3, for setting base current. This voltage, in combination with the 200K series resistor acts as a passive constant current source<br>
    the Collector voltage and current are measured by the program and plotted in real time.<br>
    An ammeter is not shown , but current is calculated using the measured voltage drop across the known resistor. I = (PV1-CH1)/1k
