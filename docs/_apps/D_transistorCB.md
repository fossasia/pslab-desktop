## Circuit Diagram
![](images/schematics/tranCB.svg ){: width="300px"}


Make the connections as shown in the figure.

Select a voltage at PV2, for setting emitter current.

the Collector voltage and current are measured by the program and plotted in real time.

An ammeter is not shown , but current is calculated using the measured voltage drop across the known resistor. I = (PV1-CH1)/1k
